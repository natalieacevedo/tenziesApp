## The reason behind this project

This project was developed because I wanted to practice my JavaScript and React skills.

## Description

This is a simple game where the goal is to get all ten dice on the same value in as little time as possible. Each die is frozen at its current value between rolls when you click it. When all dice are the same, the game is over. The app keeps track of how long it took you to complete each game and how many times you rolled the dice. Also, it keeps your best time (the lower the time, the better), and the overall fewer number of rolls game that you did on local storage. See if you can beat your own record!

I built this project using React.JS and Vanilla CSS for styling.
